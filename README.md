# Intro to HTML/CSS

## A little about me...
I'm a senior, fourth year CS major.  I've been in InnoD since my sophomore year and I have been
VP of Technology for 2 semesters.  I made all the websites you see related to InnoD (hex, main
website, makeberkeleybeautiful.com).  I started learning HTML/CSS back in elementary school when
I played Neopets, and just messing around with other people's code to see what it would do.  If
an elementary schooler can learn it, you can too!

## Overview
Web design is very much self taught.  There is no one class or one program that will teach you 
everything.  In fact, the way that I and pretty much everyone else I know learned web is just by 
trying to build a website and going from there.  At times, it can seem a little overwhelming but 
Google/Stack Overflow help a ton.  Additionally, no one is ever "done" learning, as web is 
constantly evolving.

There is a ridiculous number of articles out there for learning web related things; it's not good 
or bad. There are articles aimed to teach foundations for those just starting, to articles talking 
about how to scale distribution, to articles focused on cool animations. Don't get bogged down by 
the shear amount of information, instead just tackle things as you want. If you want to add a 
button, add the button. And then when you want to animate it, animate it. It's all a giant puzzle 
that you piece together, you just have to learn how to make the pieces at the beginning. If you see 
something you like, try to break it, remake it, and then make it yours. Just remember to give 
people credit when if you ever borrow/copy anything, even if you change it.

This goes for lots of other discplines, not just web!

My goal in the next hour is to give you a stepping stone into the world of web, just as Neopets
was my stepping stone back when I was in elementary school. I highly encourage you, if you're
genuinely interested in learning more, to pursue it on your own time; I will have resources linked
here at the end of the lesson.

## Normalize
* Used to reset base styles on each browser
* Allows you to have consistent styles across every browser

## Base CSS (in style.css)
* position
  * static: elements render in order (default value)
  * absolute: element is positioned relative to its first positioned ancestor
  * fixed: element positioned relative to the browser window (ex: [this navbar](https://www.musicbed.com/))
  * relative: element positioned relative to its normal position (where it would be
    by default, aka if position was static) - left: 20px adds 20px to element's left position
* margin, padding, border-box
  * [CSS Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp)
  * border-box sets element width, height to border, not content-box
* z-index
  * kind of like layers in graphic design
  * how far "out" of the page an element is 

## Creating Your Web Page
* Download the files

  * download everything in Intro to HTML/CS
* I have set up a very basic, minimal boilerplate
* I will walk you through how I make a simple about page in HTML, and then style it with CSS

## Sublime Text Plugins I used
* [BracketHighlighter](https://facelessuser.github.io/BracketHighlighter/installation/)
* [Emmet](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Emmet)
